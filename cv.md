## About Me

---

At the moment I work in the supply of oil and gas projects. I am 28 years old and I realized that I work in a field of activity that is not at all interesting for me. At school, the only favorite lesson for me was computer science, I especially remember the days when we wrote the simplest code in Pascal and typeset our first pages in a notebook. Previously, programming was something incomprehensible to me, but when I first wrote "Hello World", I realized that this is what I have been missing all my life. Now I am working hard on my hard skills and I want to become a good programmer with knowledge both in the front-end and back-end.
